    <h3>Ingredients for Köttbullar:</h3>
    <h4>For the meatballs:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>500g ground beef</li>
        <li>250g ground pork</li>
        <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 cup breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground allspice</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter (for frying)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the gravy:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups beef broth</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, combine the breadcrumbs and milk. Let it sit for a few minutes until the breadcrumbs have absorbed the milk.</li>
        <li>n a large mixing bowl, mix together the ground beef, ground pork, finely chopped onion, egg, salt, black pepper, allspice, and nutmeg.</li>
        <li>Add the breadcrumb mixture to the meat mixture and blend well until everything is evenly combined.</li>
        <li>Shape the mixture into small meatballs, about 1 inch in diameter, and place them on a plate or tray.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, melt 2 tablespoons of butter over medium heat. Add the meatballs to the skillet in batches, being careful not to overcrowd the pan. Cook the meatballs until they are browned on all sides and cooked through. Remove the cooked meatballs from the skillet and set them aside.</li>
        <li>To make the gravy, in the same skillet, melt 2 tablespoons of butter over medium heat. Stir in the all-purpose flour and cook for a minute or two until it's lightly browned.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the beef broth while stirring constantly to avoid lumps. Let the mixture simmer for a few minutes until it thickens.</li>
        <li>Stir in the heavy cream and soy sauce, and continue simmering for another 2-3 minutes until the gravy has a smooth and creamy consistency.</li>
        <li>Season the gravy with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked meatballs back to the skillet with the gravy, and let them simmer in the sauce for a few minutes to absorb the flavors.</li>
        <li>Serve the Köttbullar with the creamy gravy over mashed potatoes or with lingonberry sauce on the side for a traditional Swedish touch.</li>
    </ol>
