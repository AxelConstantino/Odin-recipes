        <h3>instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by soaking the Tørrfisk (Stockfish) according to the package instructions. Once rehydrated, remove any skin and bones, and flake the fish into bite-sized pieces. Set aside.</li>

            <li>Stir in the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add the sliced carrots, celery, and leek to the pot. Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables start to soften.</li>
            <li>Pour in the chopped tomatoes and fish or vegetable broth. Add the bay leaf, dried thyme, and dried parsley. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Bring the stew to a simmer and let it cook for about 20-25 minutes or until the vegetables are tender.</li>
            <li>Add the flaked Tørrfisk (Stockfish) to the stew and continue to simmer for an additional 5-10 minutes until the fish is heated through and fully incorporated into the stew.</li>
            <li>Taste the stew and adjust the seasoning if needed with more salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Remove the bay leaf from the stew before serving.</li>
            <li>Ladle the Tørrfisk Stew into bowls, and garnish with freshly chopped parsley.</li>
